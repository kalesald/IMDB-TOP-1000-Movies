# IMDB Top 1000 Movies: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the IMDB Top 1000 Movies dataset. The goal of this project was to preprocess the raw data, ensure its quality, and extract meaningful insights from it. The analysis focuses on trends in movie ratings, genres, revenue distributions, and correlations between key metrics.  

The cleaned and analyzed dataset serves as a robust foundation for further analysis, machine learning applications, or business insights.  

## Features  
- Comprehensive data cleaning to handle missing data, normalize columns, and ensure data quality.  
- Advanced filtering and visualization techniques to explore trends in movie data.  
- Detailed analysis of genre popularity, audience ratings, and revenue distributions.  

## Key Objectives  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Inspect and handle missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Normalize columns for uniformity in formatting.  
   - Ensure data integrity and reliability for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize data distributions and correlations.  
   - Analyze trends in movie ratings, genres, and box office performance.  
   - Highlight patterns and anomalies in the dataset.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Dataset Inspection**:  
   - Explored the raw dataset to understand its structure and identify missing or inconsistent data.  
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Addressed null values and standardized numerical and categorical data.  
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns for a streamlined dataset.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
   - Visualized relationships between audience ratings, criticsâ€™ scores, and revenue.  
   - Examined trends in genre popularity over time.  
   - Correlated key metrics to uncover insights into critical and commercial success factors.  

## Key Insights  
- Movies with high audience ratings tend to perform better at the box office.  
- Genres like drama and action consistently dominate both critical acclaim and commercial success.  
- Visualization of revenue distribution reveals a long tail, with a few movies generating disproportionately high earnings.
